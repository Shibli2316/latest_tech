<P>

A quantum dot display is a display device that uses quantum dots
 (QD), semiconductor nanocrystals which can produce pure
 monochromatic red, green, and blue light.

Photo-emissive quantum dot particles are used in LED-backlit
 LCDs, where QD layer converts the backlight to emit pure
 basic colors; this improves display brightness and color gamut
 by reducing light losses and color crosstalk in RGB color filters.

Electro-emissive quantum dot displays are an experimental based
 on quantum-dot light-emitting diodes (QLED or QD-LED).
 These displays are similar to active-matrix organic light-emitting
 diode (AMOLED) and MicroLED displays, in that light would be
 produced directly in each pixel by applying electric current to
 inorganic nano-particles. QD-LED displays could support large,
 flexible displays and would not degrade as readily as OLEDs,
 making them good candidates for flat-panel TV screens,
 digital cameras, mobile phones and handheld game consoles.


As of 2017, all commercial products, such as LCD TVs using
 quantum dots and branded as QLED, use photo-emissive
 particles; electro-emissive QD-LED TVs exist in laboratories
 only.

<H2><A NAME="A">Working principle</A></H2></B>
The idea of using quantum dot as a light source emerged in the
 1990s. Early applications included imaging using QD infrared
 photodetectors, light emitting diodes and single-color light
 emitting devices. Starting from early 2000, scientists started
 to realize the potential of developing quantum dot for light
 sources and displays.</P>

<P>QDs are both photo-emissive (photoluminescent) and 
electro-emissive (electroluminescent) allowing them to be
 readily incorporated into new emissive display architectures.
 Quantum dots naturally produce monochromatic light, 
so they are more efficient than white light sources when
 color filtered and allow more saturated colors that reach 
nearly 100% of Rec. 2020 color gamut.</P> 

<H2><A NAME="B">Quantum dot enhancement film</A></H2>
<P>A widespread practical application is using a QD enhancement
 film (QDEF) to improve the LED backlighting in LCD TVs.
 Light from a blue LED backlight is converted by QDs to
 relatively pure red and green, so that this combination of blue,
 green and red light incurs less blue-green crosstalk and light
 absorption in the color filters after the LCD screen, thereby 
increasing useful light throughput and providing a better
 color gamut.</P>

<P>The first manufacturer shipping TVs of this kind was Sony in 
2013 as Triluminos, Sony's trademark for the technology.
 At the Consumer Electronics Show 2015, Samsung 
Electronics, LG Electronics, TCL Corporation and Sony 
showed QD-enhanced LED-backlighting of LCD TVs. At the CES 2017, Samsung rebranded their
 'SUHD' TVs as 'QLED'; later in April 2017, Samsung formed the
 QLED Alliance with Hisense and TCL to produce and market 
QD-enhanced TVs.</P> 

<P>Traditional white LED backlights that use blue LEDs with 
on-chip or on-rail red-green QD structures are being researched,
 though high operating temperatures negatively affect their
 lifespan.</P> 

<P><H2><A NAME="C">Photo-emissive color filters</A></H2>
'QDCF' LED-backlit LCDs would use QD enhancement film with 
red/green sub-pixel patterned quantum dots, aligned to precisely
 match the red and green subpixels; blue subpixels can be 
transparent to pass through the pure blue LED backlight, or can
 be made with blue patterned quantum dots in case of UV-LED
 backlight. This configuration effectively replaces passive color
 filters, which incur substantial losses by filtering out 2/3 of 
passing light, with photo-emissive QD structures, improving 
power efficiency and/or peak brightness, and enhancing color 
purity. Because quantum dots depolarize the light,
 output polarizer (the analyzer) needs to be moved behind the
 color filter; this would also improve viewing angles. 
To reduce self-excitement of QD film and to improve efficiency, 
the ambient light can be blocked using traditional color filters,
 and reflective polarizers can direct light from QD filters towards
 the viewer. As only blue or UV light passes through the liquid
 crystal layer, it can be made thinner, resulting in faster pixel
 response times.</P>

<P>Nanosys made presentations of their photo-emissive technology
 during 2017; commercial products are expected in 2018.</P>

<P><H2><A NAME="D">Active-matrix light-emitting diodes</A></H2>
See also: AMOLED, MicroLED, and LED displayAMQLED
 displays will use electroluminescent QD nanoparticles 
functioning as Quantum-dot-based LEDs (QD-LEDs or QLEDs)
 arranged in an active matrix array. Rather than requiring a
 separate LED backlight for illumination and TFT 
LCD to control the brightness, these QLED displays
 would natively control the light emitted by individual 
pixels, greatly reducing pixel response times by 
eliminating the liquid crystal layer.</P>

<P>The structure of a QD-LED is similar to the basic design
 of an OLED. The major difference is that the light emitting
 devices are quantum dots, such as cadmium selenide (CdSe)
 nanocrystals. A layer of quantum dots is sandwiched between
 layers of electron-transporting and hole-transporting organic
 materials. An applied electric field causes electrons and holes to 
move into the quantum dot layer, where they are captured in
 the quantum dot and recombine, emitting photons.
 The demonstrated color gamut from QD-LEDs exceeds the
 performance of both LCD and OLED display technologies.</P>

<P>Mass production of active-matrix QLED displays is expected to
 begin in 2019.</P> 

<P><H2><A NAME="E">Optical properties of quantum dots</A></H2>
Performance of QDs is determined by the size and/or composition
 of the QD structures. Unlike simple atomic structures, 
a quantum dot structure has the unusual property that energy
 levels are strongly dependent on the structure's size. 
For example, CdSe quantum dot light emission can be tuned from
 red (5 nm diameter) to the violet region (1.5 nm dot).
 The physical reason for QD coloration is the quantum 
confinement effect and is directly related to their energy levels.
 The bandgap energy that determines the energy (and hence color)
 of the fluorescent light is inversely proportional to the square of
 the size of quantum dot. Larger QDs have more energy levels that
 are more closely spaced, allowing the QD to emit (or absorb) 
photons of lower energy (redder color). In other words, 
the emitted photon energy increases as the dot size decreases,
 because greater energy is required to confine the semiconductor 
excitation to a smaller volume.</P>

<P>Newer quantum dot structures employ iridium instead of
 cadmium, as the latter is not exempted for use in lighting by the
 European Commission RoHS directive.</P>

<P>QD-LEDs are characterized by pure and saturated emission 
colors with narrow bandwidth, characterized by full width at
 half the maximum value in the range of 20-40 nm.
 Their emission wavelength is easily tuned by changing the size
 of the quantum dots. Moreover, QD-LED offer high color purity
 and durability combined with the efficiency, flexibility,
 and low processing cost of comparable organic light-emitting
 devices. QD-LED structure can be tuned over the entire visible
 wavelength range from 460 nm (blue) to 650 nm (red) 
(the human eye can detect light from 380 to 750 nm). 
The emission wavelengths have been continuously extended to
 UV and NIR range by tailoring the chemical composition of the
 QDs and device structure.</P>

<P><H2><A NAME="F">Fabrication process</A></H2>
Quantum dots are solution processable and suitable for wet
 processing techniques. The two major fabrication techniques for 
QD-LED are called phase separation and contact-printing.</P>

<P><H2><A NAME="G">Phase separation</A></H2>
Phase separation is suitable for forming large-area ordered QD 
monolayers. A single QD layer is formed by spin casting a mixed 
solution of QD and TPD. This process simultaneously yields QD 
monolayers self-assembled into hexagonally close-packed arrays 
and places this monolayer on top of a co-deposited contact. 
During solvent drying, the QDs phase separate from the organic 
under-layer material (TPD) and rise towards the film's surface. 
The resulting QD structure is affected by many parameters: 
solution concentration, solvent ration, QD size distribution and 
QD aspect ratio. Also important is QD solution and organic 
solvent purity.</P>

<P>Although phase separation is relatively simple, it is not suitable 
for display device applications. Since spin-casting does not allow 
lateral patterning of different sized QDs (RGB), phase separation
 cannot create a multi-color QD-LED. Moreover, it is not ideal to
 have an organic under-layer material for a QD-LED; an organic 
under-layer must be homogeneous, a constraint which limits
 the number of applicable device designs.</P>

<P><H2><A NAME="H">Contact printing</A></H2>
The contact printing process for forming QD thin films is a
 solvent-free[contradictory] method, which is simple and cost
 efficient with high throughput. During the process, the device
 structure is not exposed to solvents. Since charge transport
 layers in QD-LED structures are solvent-sensitive organic thin
 films, avoiding solvent during the process is a major benefit.
 This method can produce RGB patterned electroluminescent
 structures with 1000 ppi (pixels-per-inch) resolution.</P>

<P>The overall process of contact printing:
Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is molded using a silicon master.
Top side of resulting PDMS stamp is coated with a thin film of
 parylene-c, a chemical-vapor deposited (CVD) aromatic organic
 polymer.<BR>
Parylene-c coated stamp is inked via spin-casting of a solution of
 colloidal QDs suspended in an organic solvent.[contradictory]
After the solvent evaporates, the formed QD monolayer is
 transferred to the substrate by contact printing.
The array of quantum dots is manufactured by self-assembly
 in a process known as spin casting: a solution of quantum dots
 in an organic material is poured onto a substrate, which is then
 set spinning to spread the solution evenly.</P>

<P>Contact printing allows fabrication of multi-color QD-LEDs. 
A QD-LED was fabricated with an emissive layer consisting
 of 25-�m wide stripes of red, green and blue QD monolayers. 
Contact printing methods also minimize the amount of QD 
required, reducing costs.</P>

<P><H2><A NAME="I">Comparison</A></H2>
Nanocrystal displays would render as much as a 30% increase
 in the visible spectrum, while using 30 to 50% less power than
 LCDs, in large part because nanocrystal displays wouldn't need
 backlighting. QD LEDs are 50-100 times brighter than CRT and
 LCD displays, emitting 40,000 cd/m2. QDs are soluble in both 
aqueous and non-aqueous solvents, which provides for printable
 and flexible displays of all sizes, including large area TVs.
 QDs can be inorganic, offering the potential for improved
 lifetimes compared to OLED (however, since many parts of
 QD-LED are often made of organic materials, further 
development is required to improve the functional lifetime.)
 In addition to OLED displays, pick-and-place microLED displays
 are emerging as competing technologies to nanocrystal displays.</P>

<P>Other advantages include better saturated green colors, 
manufacturability on polymers, thinner display and the
 use of the same material to generate different colors.</P>

<P>One disadvantage is that blue quantum dots require highly 
precise timing control during the reaction, because blue quantum 
dots are just slightly above the minimum size. Since sunlight
 contains roughly equal luminosities of red, green and blue 
across the entire spectrum, a display also needs to produce
 roughly equal lumunosities of red, green and blue to achieve
 pure white as defined by CIE Standard Illuminant D65. 
However the blue component in the disSplay can have relatively
 lower color purity and/or precision (dynamic range) in comparison 
to green and red, because human eye is three to five times
 less sensitive to blue in daylight conditions according to CIE
 luminosity function.</P>
