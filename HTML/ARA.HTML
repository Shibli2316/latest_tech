<P>Project Ara was a modular smartphone project under development by
 Google. The project was originally headed by the Advanced Technology
 and Projects team within Motorola Mobility while it was a Google
 subsidiary. Google retained the ATAP group when selling Motorola
 to Lenovo, and it was placed under the stewardship of the Android
 development staff; Ara was later split off as an independent operation.</P>

<P>Under its original design, Project Ara was supposed to consist of
 hardware modules providing common smartphone parts, such as processors,
 displays, batteries, and cameras, as well as modules providing more 
 specialized components, and "frames" that these modules were to be 
 attached to. This design would allow a device to be upgraded over 
 time with new capabilities and upgraded without requiring the purchase 
 of an entire new device, providing a longer lifecycle for the device
 and potentially reducing electronic waste. However, by 2016, the
 concept had been revised, resulting in a base phone with non-upgradable
 core components, and modules providing supplemental features.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="PICS/ARA USING 1.JPG">

<P>Google planned to launch a new developer version of Ara in the
 fourth quarter of 2016, with a target bill of materials cost of
 $50 for a basic phone, leading into a planned consumer launch in
 2017. However, on September 2, 2016, Reuters reported that two
 non-disclosed sources leaked that the Alphabet's manufacture of frames 
 had been cancelled, and may be licensed to third parties; and that a
 spokesman declined to comment on the rumours</P>
