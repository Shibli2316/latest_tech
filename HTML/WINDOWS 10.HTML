Windows 10 is a personal computer operating
system developed and released by Microsoft 
as part of the Windows NT family of operating
systems. It was released on July 29, 2015. 
It is the first version of Windows that 
receives updates that add new features, 
and also the first version whose major 
updates are in the form of full OS images, 
as opposed to service packs. Devices in 
enterprise environments can receive these 
updates at a slower pace, or use long-term 
support milestones that only receive critical 
updates, such as security patches, over their 
ten-year lifespan of extended support.It is 
the last version of the Windows family.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">
Windows 10 introduces what Microsoft described 
as "universal apps"; expanding on Metro-style
apps, these apps can be designed to run across 
multiple Microsoft product families with 
nearly identical code including PCs, tablets, 
smartphones, embedded systems, Xbox One, 
Surface Hub and Mixed Reality.The Windows user
interface was revised to handle transitions 
between a mouse oriented interface and a 
touchscreen optimized interface based on 
available input devices particularly on 2 in 1 
PCs; both interfaces include an updated Start 
menu which incorporates elements of Windows 
7's traditional Start menu with the tiles of 
Windows 8. The first release of Windows 10 
also introduces a virtual desktop system, a 
window and desktop management feature called 
Task View, the Microsoft Edge web browser, 
support for fingerprint and face recognition 
login, new security features for enterprise 
environments, and DirectX 12 and WDDM 2.0 to 
improve the operating system's graphics 
capabilities for games.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">
Windows 10 received mostly positive reviews 
upon its original release in July 2015; 
critics praised Microsoft's decision to 
provide a desktop-oriented interface in 
line with previous versions of Windows, 
contrasting the tablet-oriented approach of 8
, although Windows 10's touch-oriented user 
interface mode was panned for containing 
regressions upon the touch-oriented interface
of Windows 8. Critics also praised the 
improvements to Windows 10's bundled 
software over Windows 8.1, Xbox Live 
integration, as well as the functionality 
and capabilities of Cortana personal 
assistant and the replacement of Internet 
Explorer with Microsoft Edge. However, media 
outlets have been critical of changes to 
operating system behaviors, including 
mandatory update installation, privacy 
concerns over data collection performed 
by the OS for Microsoft and its partners, 
and the adware-like tactics used to promote 
the operating system on its release.

At the Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference
in 2011, Andrew Lees, the chief of Microsoft's
mobile technologies, said that the company 
intended to have a single software ecosystem 
for PCs, phones, tablets, and other devices. 
"We wonï¿½t have an ecosystem for PCs, and one 
for phones, and one for tablets they'll all 
come together."

In December 2013, technology writer Mary Jo 
Foley reported that Microsoft was working on 
an update to Windows 8 codenamed "Threshold", 
after a planet in Microsoft's Halo video 
game franchise.Similarly to "Blue" 
(which became Windows 8.1), Foley called 
Threshold a "wave of operating systems" 
across multiple Microsoft platforms and 
services, scheduled for the second quarter 
of 2015. Foley reported that among the goals 
for Threshold was to create a unified 
application platform and development toolkit 
for Windows, Windows Phone and Xbox One 
(which all use a similar Windows NT kernel.


<P ALIGN="CENTER">
In April 2014, at the Build Conference, 
Microsoft's Terry Myerson unveiled an 
updated version of Windows 8.1 that added 
the ability to run Windows Store apps inside 
desktop windows and a more traditional Start 
menu in place of the Start screen seen in 
Windows 8. The new Start menu takes after 
Windows 7's design by using only a portion 
of the screen and including a Windows 
7-style application listing in the first 
column. The second column displays Windows 
8-style app tiles. Myerson said that these 
changes would occur in a future update, but 
did not elaborate.Microsoft also 
unveiled the concept of a "universal Windows 
app", allowing Windows Store apps created 
for Windows 8.1 to be ported to Windows 
Phone 8.1 and Xbox One while sharing a
common codebase, with an interface designed 
for different device form factors, and 
allowing user data and licenses for an app 
to be shared between multiple platforms. 
Windows Phone 8.1 would share nearly 90% of 
the common Windows Runtime APIs with Windows
8.1 on PCs.
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
Screenshots of a Windows build which 
purported to be Threshold were leaked in 
July 2014, showing the previously presented 
Start menu and windowed Windows Store apps 
followed by a further screenshot in September
 2014 of a build identifying itself as 
"Windows Technical Preview", numbered 9834, 
showing a new virtual desktop system, a 
notification center, and a new File Explorer 
icon.

Windows 10 harmonizes the user experience and
 functionality between different classes of 
device, and addresses shortcomings in the 
user interface that were introduced in 
Windows 8. Windows 10 Mobile, 
the successor to Windows Phone 8.1, shares 
some user interface elements and apps with 
its PC counterpart.
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
The Windows Runtime app ecosystem was 
revised into the Universal Windows Platform 
(UWP).These universal apps are 
made to run across multiple platforms and 
device classes, including smartphones,
tablets, Xbox One consoles, and other 
compatible Windows 10 devices. Windows 
apps share code across platforms, have 
responsive designs that adapt to the needs 
of the device and available inputs, can 
synchronize data between Windows 10 devices 
(including notifications, credentials, 
and allowing cross-platform multiplayer for 
games), and are distributed through a unified
Windows Store. Developers can allow 
"cross-buys", where purchased licenses for 
an app apply to all of the user's compatible
devices, rather than only the one they 
purchased on (e.g., a user purchasing an app
on PC is also entitled to use the smartphone 
version at no extra cost).
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
On Windows 10, Windows Store serves as a 
unified storefront for apps, music, films, 
TV series and ebooks.Windows 10 also 
allows web apps and desktop software 
(using either Win32 or .NET Framework) to be
packaged for distribution on the Windows 
Store. Desktop software distributed through 
Windows Store is packaged using the App-V 
system to allow sandboxing.

Windows Media Center was discontinued, and 
is uninstalled when upgrading from a 
previous version of Windows. 
Upgraded Windows installations with Media 
Center will receive the paid app Windows DVD 
Player free of charge for a limited, but 
unspecified, time.Microsoft had 
previously relegated Media Center and 
integrated DVD playback support to a paid 
add-on beginning on Windows 8 due to the 
cost of licensing the required DVD decoders, 
and the increasing number of PC devices that 
have no optical drives.
<p><P ALIGN="CENTER">
The OneDrive built-in sync client, which was 
introduced in Windows 8.1, no longer supports 
offline placeholders for online-only files
in Windows 10.This functionality was re-added 
in Windows 10 version 1709, under the name 
"OneDrive Files On-Demand".
<p><P ALIGN="CENTER">
Users are no longer able to synchronize Start
 menu layouts across all devices associated 
with a Microsoft account. A Microsoft 
developer justified the change by explaining 
that a user may have different applications 
they want to emphasize on each device that 
they use, rather than use the same 
configuration across each device. 
The ability to automatically install a 
Windows Store app across all devices 
associated with an account was also removed.
<p><P ALIGN="CENTER">
Web browsers can no longer set themselves as 
a user's default without further intervention;
changing the default web browser must be 
performed manually by the user from Settings'
"Default apps" page, ostensibly to prevent 
browser hijacking.
<P><P ALIGN="CENTER">
Parental controls no longer support browsers 
other than Internet Explorer and Edge, and 
the ability to control browsing by a 
whitelist was removed.Also removed
were the ability to control local accounts, 
and the ability to scan a machine for 
applications to allow and block.

<p><P ALIGN="CENTER">
The Food & Drink, Health & Fitness, and 
Travel apps have been discontinued.

Drivers for floppy drives are no longer 
integrated and must be downloaded separately.

<p><P ALIGN="CENTER">
While all Windows 10 editions include fonts 
that provide broad language support, some 
fonts for Middle Eastern and East Asian 
languages (Arabic, Chinese, Hindi, Japanese, 
Korean, etc.) are no longer included with 
the standard installation to reduce storage 
space used, but are available without charge
as optional font packages. When software 
invokes text in languages other than those 
for which the system is configured and does 
not use the Windows font fallback mechanisms 
designed always to display legible glyphs,
Windows displays unsupported characters as a 
default "not defined" glyph, a square or 
rectangular box, or a box with a dot, 
question mark or "x" inside.

<P><P ALIGN="CENTER">Windows Defender could be integrated into 
File Explorer's context menu in Windows 8.x, 
but Microsoft initially removed integration 
from Windows 10, restoring it in Windows 10 
build 10571 in response to user feedback.

<P><P ALIGN="CENTER">User control over Windows Updates was 
removed (except in enterprise versions). 
In earlier versions users could opt for 
updates to be installed automatically, or to 
be notified so they could update as and when 
they wished, or not to be notified; and they 
could choose which updates to install, using 
information about the updates. Windows 10 
Pro and Enterprise users may be configured 
by an administrator to defer updates, but 
only for a limited time.Under the 
Windows end-user license agreement, users 
consent to the automatic installation of all 
updates, features and drivers provided by 
the service, and to the automatic removal or 
changes to features being modified is not 
required; it is implicit "without any
additional notice".
